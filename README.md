# CustomPaper

This is a customized forked version of [Paper by nanxiaobei](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/hugo-paper) made to the liking of my personal preference.

## Install

Inside the folder of your Hugo site, run:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/binhonglee/custompaper themes/custompaper
```

Then change in `config.toml`:

```toml
theme = "custompaper"
```

For more information read the official [guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-3-add-a-theme) of Hugo.
